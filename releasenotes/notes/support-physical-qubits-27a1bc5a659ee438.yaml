    Added the ability to handle references to physical qubits. A layout is
    included in the output circuit that maps a quantum register to the
    non-negative integers identifying the physical qubits in the order that they
    are encountered in the OpenQASM 3 code.

    Currently mixing references to physical qubits with declarations of virtual
    qubits in an OpenQASM 3 program is not allowed and raises an error.
