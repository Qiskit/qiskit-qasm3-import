    The 0.4.2 release fixes a bug in handling circuits defined on hardware qubits.  This release
    also adds an Apache-2.0 licence header to the source files in the distribution; the project has
    always been Apache-2.0 licensed, and the full licence file has always been distributed with it,
    but the additional standard Qiskit per-file notice was accidentally absent.
