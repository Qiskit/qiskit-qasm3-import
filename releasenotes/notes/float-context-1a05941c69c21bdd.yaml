    Gate-parameter contexts now permit ``float`` and ``angle`` types to interact via multiplication
    and division.  Strictly this is against the OpenQASM 3 specification, but in practice, Qiskit
    often outputs this kind of expression during its OpenQASM 3 exports, because of problems in how
    symbolic parameters are represented in Qiskit.  This parser will now accept such statements to
    work around the technically invalid OpenQASM 3 output by Qiskit, if ``strict=False``.
