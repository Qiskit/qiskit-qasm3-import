    The internal-only method of handling circuits that define a parameter that they do not use
    (such as a program that defines ``input float a;`` but doesn't use ``a``) has changed to
    avoid using private Qiskit methods.  This makes it more resilient to changing versions
    of Qiskit.

    OpenQASM 3 inputs that include ``input float`` parameters that are not used by the program
    will now parse to circuits that have a global phase that appears parametrised in terms of
    the otherwise-unused parameter.  The numerical value of the global phase will not be affected,
    and the global phase will be independent of the parameters.  You can discard the parameter
    by using ``QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters`` to assign any numeric value to the parameter.
