    The 0.5.0 release makes the default importing mode less strict about
    mixing floating-point and angle types in gate bodies.  This is to support
    Qiskit's export, which is unfortunately inconsistent with the letter of the
    specification due to technical limitiations in Qiskit's internal representation.
