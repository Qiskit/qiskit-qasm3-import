    This package now depends on `qiskit>=0.37,<1.0` instead of `qiskit-terra>=0.21`.  This reflects
    how the Qiskit package is now structured, with the lower bound referring to the same version of
    Terra.  This package is due to cease being the preferred OpenQASM 3 importer for Qiskit around
    the 1.0, but the upper bound is more specifically because the package is not yet guaranteeing
    that it will support all the changes.
